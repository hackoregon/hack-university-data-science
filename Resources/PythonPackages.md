# Python distribution

You will need to install an integrated Python distribution, including packages numpy, matplotlib, and pandas, as well as iPython with notebook. I prefer [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), but [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) should also work if you already have that installed. Make sure to choose Python **3**.


# Packages

# IDE

You may wish to use an IDE. Some options:

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), a developer favorite
* [yHat Rodeo](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo), a new IDE designed for data science (warning - so new that the bugs are not worked out)
